TBD Q3 2021 - Figures release 0.4 "Official"
============================================

**Most recent release**: "0.4.dev16" on August 11, 2021

Figures is iterating through "0.4.dev" development releases on the way to
an official 0.4 release.

The Figures 0.4.dev releases support Open edX Juniper, Hawthorn, and Ginkgo

* The reason for "dev" (development) instead of "rc" (release candidate) is that
  the 'dev' label lets us be free to make breaking changes, whereas an "rc"
  label is about making sure a release is stable for general community use

* Appsembler deploys "0.4.dev" releases to Tahoe production and Figures is used
  by our customers. This is similar to how Open edX deploys "master/main" to
  "edx.org" then creates named releases

* Most of the ongoing work is in the following areas
  
  * Improving the daily pipeline tasks for accuracy, reliability, and
    performance
  * Improving API performance
  * Bug fixing

Please visit Figures `releases page <https://github.com/appsembler/figures/releases>`__ for details on specific releases.

--------
Overview
--------

Figures is a reporting and data retrieval app. It plugs into the edx-platform LMS app server. Its goal is to provide site-wide and cross-course analytics that compliment Open edX's traditional course-centric analytics.

To evolve Figures to meet community needs, we are keeping in mind as principles the following features, which Jill Vogel outlined in her `lightweight analytics <https://edxchange.opencraft.com/t/analytics-lighter-faster-cheaper/202>`__ post on ed Xchange:

* Real time (or near real time) updates
* Lightweight deployment
* Flexible reporting
* Simpler contributions

Please refer to the Figures `design document <https://docs.google.com/document/d/16orj6Ag1R158-J-zSBfiY31RKQ5FuSu1O5F-zpSKOg4/>`__ for more details on goals and architecture.

------------
Requirements
------------

For all Open edX releases:

* Python (2.7)

For Hawthorn:

* Django (1.11)

For Ginkgo:

* Django (1.8)



.. _installation:

------------
Installation
------------

*NOTICE: Installation instructions are out of date and backlogged for update*


Devstack
========

Go `here <docs/source/devstack.rst>`__ for instructions to install and run Figures in devstack.

Production
==========

Go `here <docs/source/install.rst>`__ for instructions to install Figures in production.

--------------------
Project Architecture
--------------------

Front-end
=========

The Figures user interface is a JavaScript Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and uses the `create-react-app <https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app>`_ build scaffolding generator.

Back-end
========

The Figures back-end is a reusable Django app. It contains a set of REST API endpoints that serve a dual purpose of providing data to the front-end and to remote clients.

-------
Testing
-------

*TODO: Improve the testing instructions*

The unit tests **should** be able to run on any OS that supports Python 2.7.x

Clone the repo:

::

 	git@github.com:appsembler/figures.git

Go to the project directory:

::

	cd figures

Create a `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__ for Python 2.7.x.

Install required Python packages:

::

	pip install -r devsite/requirements.txt

From the `figures` repository root directory:

::

	py.test

If all goes well, the Figures unit tests will all complete succesfully

------
Future
------

* Open edX "Hawthorn" will provide a plug-in architecture. This will hopefully simplify Figures installation even more
* Downloadable report files
* Plugin architecture to extend Figures for custom data sources
