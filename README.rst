--------
Overview
--------

Figures is a reporting and data retrieval app. It plugs into the edx-platform LMS app server. Its goal is to provide site-wide and cross-course analytics that compliment Open edX's traditional course-centric analytics.

To evolve Figures to meet community needs, we are keeping in mind as principles the following features, which Jill Vogel outlined in her `lightweight analytics <https://edxchange.opencraft.com/t/analytics-lighter-faster-cheaper/202>`__ post on ed Xchange:

* Real time (or near real time) updates
* Lightweight deployment
* Flexible reporting
* Simpler contributions

Please refer to the Figures `design document <https://docs.google.com/document/d/16orj6Ag1R158-J-zSBfiY31RKQ5FuSu1O5F-zpSKOg4/>`__ for more details on goals and architecture.

------------
Requirements
------------

For all Open edX releases:

* Python (2.7)

For Hawthorn:

* Django (1.11)

For Ginkgo:

* Django (1.8)



.. _installation:

------------
Installation
------------

*NOTICE: Installation instructions are out of date and backlogged for update*


Devstack
========

Go `here <docs/source/devstack.rst>`__ for instructions to install and run Figures in devstack.

Production
==========

Go `here <docs/source/install.rst>`__ for instructions to install Figures in production.

--------------------
Project Architecture
--------------------

Front-end
=========

The Figures user interface is a JavaScript Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and uses the `create-react-app <https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app>`_ build scaffolding generator.

Back-end
========

The Figures back-end is a reusable Django app. It contains a set of REST API endpoints that serve a dual purpose of providing data to the front-end and to remote clients.

-------
Testing
-------

*TODO: Improve the testing instructions*

The unit tests **should** be able to run on any OS that supports Python 2.7.x

Clone the repo:

::

 	git@github.com:appsembler/figures.git

Go to the project directory:

::

	cd figures

Create a `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__ for Python 2.7.x.

Install required Python packages:

::

	pip install -r devsite/requirements.txt

From the `figures` repository root directory:

::

	py.test

If all goes well, the Figures unit tests will all complete succesfully


-------------
Configuration
-------------

Figures can be configured via Django settings' ``FIGURES`` key. Open edX reads configuration from
the ``/edx/etc/lms.yml`` file both in devstack and production servers. In releases before Juniper it
was the ``lms.env.json`` file.

A Figures configuration may look like the following:


::

	FEATURES:  # The standard Open edX feature flags
		# ... other features goes here ...
		FIGURES_IS_MULTISITE: True
		# ... more features goes there ...

	FIGURES:  # Other Figures configurations
		SITES_BACKEND: 'openedx.core.djangoapps.appsembler.sites.utils:get_active_sites'
		REQUESTED_SITE_BACKEND: 'tahoe_figures_plugins.sites:get_current_site_or_by_uuid'
		FIGURES_PIPELINE_TASKS_ROUTING_KEY: 'edx.lms.core.high'
		DAILY_METRICS_IMPORT_HOUR: 13
		DAILY_METRICS_IMPORT_MINUTE: 0


Settings like ``SITES_BACKEND`` require a path to a Python function or class. The path is consists of two parts:
a Python module e.g. ``my_plugin_package.helpers`` and an object e.g ``my_helper`` separated by a colon e.g.
``my_plugin_package.helpers:my_helper``.

This object would be imported by the ``import_from_path`` helper in the
`figures/helpers.py <https://github.com/appsembler/figures/blob/932eeab84c469a34dfcb94232bbe6f7c08146b3f/figures/helpers.py#L84-L98>`__ module.

.....................
Configuration options
.....................


* ``FEATURES.FIGURES_IS_MULTISITE`` (default ``False``): Boolean feature flag to run Figures in a single-site mode by
  default (when set to ``False``) most popular Open edX installation option.
  The multisite mode requires a custom ``edx-organizations`` fork that is used for
  Appsembler Tahoe clusters.

* ``FIGURES.SITES_BACKEND`` (default ``None``): A Python path to function to list figures sites.
  For example, this is useful to customize which sites are processed and which are considered inactive.
  By default (when ``None`` is used) all sites are listed in the multi-site mode.

* ``REQUESTED_SITE_BACKEND`` (default ``None``): Python path to a function that gets the current site.
  For example it can be used for API purposes to pass a Site ID to get a different site.
  By default (when ``None`` is used) the Django's ``get_current_site()`` helper is used.


**TBD:** Document ``FIGURES_PIPELINE_TASKS_ROUTING_KEY``, ``DAILY_METRICS_IMPORT_HOUR`` and ``DAILY_METRICS_IMPORT_MINUTE``.

------
Future
------

* Open edX "Hawthorn" will provide a plug-in architecture. This will hopefully simplify Figures installation even more
* Downloadable report files
* Plugin architecture to extend Figures for custom data sources
